* Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-the-breakthrough-starshot-mission-to-alpha-centauri/
* trekdecks uses Enterprise deck as found at: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution_class_decks

* Defiant class decks: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Defiant_class_decks
* Intrepid class decks: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Intrepid_class_decks
* trekdests Destinations used: https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1378/top-10-star-trek-destinations-chosen-by-nasa-scientists/
* exodests from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates
* sspythondecks created for a simple example

1. Copy the files wise.py, prt.py and shipchip.py (as code.py) to neotrinkey.
2. Copy a "dests" file (trekdests or exodests) to neotrinkey as "dests"
3. Copy a "decks" file (trekdecks or sspythondecks) to neotrinkey as "decks"
        (Or create your own list of decks and dests.)

Change REPL=True to REPL=False if you want output to be "typed" via HID interface.

Change showdecks = False to showdecks = True if you want the decks to be listed on start.

Touch pad #1 to go "up" a deckand pad #2 to go down - holding both jumps to a random deck.
